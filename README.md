Getting Started
Prerequisites:

Java 21 JDK
Maven 3.6+
PostgreSQL (or any JDBC-compatible DB)
Clone the repository to your machine.
Configure the database in application.properties (example values are included):
Create the ems database in PostgreSQL (or change the URL to point to your DB).

Build and run the application with Maven:

Or build the jar and run it:

The application starts on the default Spring Boot port 8080.

Retrieve list of all employees
Response: 200 OK with JSON array of employee objects

Notes:

The project uses EmployeeDto for request/response and Employee entity for persistence. Field names are mapped by a small EmployeeMapper.
The example application.properties points to a local PostgreSQL instance and uses spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update for convenience in development.
